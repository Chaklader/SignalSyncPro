SUMO Configuration Files for SignalSyncPro
==========================================

This directory contains SUMO configuration files used by both:
- Rule-based developed control (controls/rule_based/developed/main.py)
- DRL agent (training/train_drl.py, testing/test_drl.py)

Files:
------
1. signal_sync.sumocfg
   Main SUMO configuration file that orchestrates the simulation.
   
   Contains:
   - Network file: Path to road network (common.net.xml)
   - Route files: Vehicle routes (privateCar, bicycle, pedestrian, bus)
   - Additional files: Detectors and bus stops
   - GUI settings: Visual appearance (signal_sync_gui_settings.cfg)
   - Simulation parameters: Time limits, teleport settings, port configuration
   
2. signal_sync_gui_settings.cfg
   GUI visualization settings for SUMO-GUI.
   
   Contains:
   - View settings (zoom, position)
   - Display options (vehicle shapes, colors)
   - Background settings

Path Structure:
---------------
All paths in signal_sync.sumocfg are relative to this directory:
- Network: ../../../infrastructure/developed/common/network/common.net.xml
- Routes: ../../../infrastructure/developed/common/routes/*.rou.xml
- Detectors: ../../../infrastructure/developed/common/detector/common.det.xml
- Bus stops: ../../../infrastructure/developed/common/bus_stop/common_bus_stop.add.xml

Usage:
------
Python code references this config as:
    "configurations/developed/common/signal_sync.sumocfg"

SUMO connects via TraCI on port 8816 (configured in signal_sync.sumocfg).

Notes:
------
- Routes are dynamically generated before each training episode
- Simulation duration: 3600 seconds (1 hour) controlled by SIMULATION_LIMIT constant
- Log file output is commented out to reduce disk I/O during training

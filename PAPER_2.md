SCALE UP:
Current: 2 intersections (semi-coordinated)
New: 5-10 intersections in arterial corridor

Challenge: How do agents communicate and coordinate?

INNOVATION:
Compare coordination strategies: 1. Centralized: Single agent controls all (baseline) 2. Independent: Each intersection has own agent (your current approach) 3. Communication: Agents share state information 4. Hierarchical: Master agent + local agents 5. Graph Neural Networks: Model intersection network

WHY VALUABLE:

- Realistic traffic demand (morning/evening peaks)

COORDINATION APPROACHES:

1. INDEPENDENT Q-LEARNING (Baseline)

   - Your current reward function ✓
   - No coordination

2. CENTRALIZED DQN

   - Controls all 6 intersections
   - Computationally expensive but optimal

3. QMIX (Coordination via Value Decomposition)

   - Decentralized execution
   - Centralized training
   - Learn to coordinate without communication

4. CommNet (Communication Architecture)

TODO:

1. Use Scale to 250-2500: Similar density per TLS as single-agent
2. Need to make sure both AI and rule based agent dont go to P1 right after P1. They will need to pass through P2
   earliest.
3. Add an analysis for P2/P3/P4 phases for 64-72s duration when the cars/bus passes between the intersections.

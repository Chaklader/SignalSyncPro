TODO:

1. Use Scale to 250-2500: Similar density per TLS as single-agent for 30 scenarios
2. Need to make sure both AI and rule based agent dont go to P1 right after P1. They will need to pass through P2
   earliest.
3. We need to track the waiting time and emission for the 30 scenarios for rule based with and without semi-sync controls
4. Check if 2-intersection corridor based controls testing still works fine
5. Correct the lane allowance and intersection radius for the 5-TLS network topology

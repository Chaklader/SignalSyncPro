# Reward Function Update Summary

## Changes Made

Updated DRL reward function to use **weighted average waiting time** as the primary metric instead of stopped ratio, with rebalanced component weights for better learning signals.

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `drl/config.py`

**Reward Weight Changes:**

| Component | Old Value | New Value | Reasoning |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| `ALPHA_WAIT` | 1.0 | **0.5** | Reduced to allow positive rewards |
| `ALPHA_SYNC` | 0.5 | **3.0** | STRONG incentive for coordination |
| `ALPHA_EMISSION` | 0.1 | **0.01** | Small but present (sustainability) |
| `ALPHA_EQUITY` | 0.2 | **0.05** | Small but present (fairness) |
| `ALPHA_SAFETY` | 3.0 | **5.0** | CRITICAL - even higher priority |
| `ALPHA_PED_DEMAND` | 0.5 | **1.0** | Stronger pedestrian responsiveness |

**Key Points:**
- ✅ All components kept active (CO₂, equity, safety)
- ✅ Safety remains non-negotiable (highest penalty)
- ✅ Sync bonus now overwhelms small penalties
- ✅ Balanced for positive reward achievement

---

### 2. `drl/reward.py`

**Primary Metric Change:**

```python
# OLD: Stopped ratio (percentage of stopped vehicles)
stopped_ratio = weighted_stopped / weighted_total
reward = -ALPHA_WAIT * stopped_ratio

# NEW: Weighted average waiting time (seconds)
weighted_wait = self._calculate_weighted_waiting(waiting_times_by_mode)
normalized_wait = min(weighted_wait / 60.0, 1.0)
reward = -ALPHA_WAIT * normalized_wait
```

**Reward Calculation Steps (Updated):**

1. **Count vehicles and collect metrics** by mode
2. **Calculate weighted average waiting time** (PRIMARY METRIC)
3. **Normalize** waiting time to [0, 1] range (max 60 seconds)
4. **Base reward**: -ALPHA_WAIT × normalized_wait
5. **Flow bonus**: +(1 - normalized_wait) × 0.5
6. **Sync bonus**: +ALPHA_SYNC (3.0) if both in Phase 1
7. **CO₂ penalty**: -ALPHA_EMISSION × co2_per_vehicle
8. **Equity penalty**: -ALPHA_EQUITY × variance_across_modes
9. **Safety penalty**: -ALPHA_SAFETY (5.0) if violations
10. **Pedestrian handling**: penalty/bonus based on response
11. **Clip**: [-10, 10] (wider range for clearer signals)

**Reward Range:**

| Scenario | Old Range | New Range |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Typical | -1.0 to +1.5 | -2.0 to +3.5 |
| Worst case | -2.0 | -7.0 (safety violation) |
| Best case | +2.0 | +3.5 (low wait + sync) |
| Clip range | [-2, 2] | [-10, 10] |

## Expected Reward Breakdown

### Component Contributions:

```
Waiting time:      -0.5 to 0      (primary penalty)
Flow bonus:        0 to +0.25     (encouragement)
Sync bonus:        0 to +3.0      (STRONG incentive)
CO₂ penalty:       -0.02 to 0     (small sustainability nudge)
Equity penalty:    -0.05 to 0     (small fairness nudge)
Safety penalty:    -5.0 or 0      (CRITICAL when violated)
Ped penalty/bonus: -1.0 to +0.5   (responsive to pedestrians)
```

---

## Why This Works Better

### 1. **Primary Metric Alignment**
- Waiting time matches thesis evaluation metrics
- More meaningful than stopped ratio for traffic control
- Directly reflects user experience

### 2. **Balanced Learning Signals**
- Positive rewards achievable (sync bonus 3.0 > penalties)
- Agent can learn to optimize for coordination
- Clearer gradient for neural network

### 3. **All Components Active**
- ✅ CO₂ emissions tracked (environmental sustainability)
- ✅ Equity measured (fairness across modes)
- ✅ Safety enforced (non-negotiable constraints)
- ✅ Pedestrian demand handled (multimodal responsiveness)

### 4. **Strong Coordination Incentive**
- Sync bonus (3.0) overwhelms small penalties
- Agent learns that coordination is highly valuable
- Matches thesis semi-synchronization objective

### 5. **Safety Priority**
- Highest penalty (5.0) prevents dangerous timings
- Cannot be disabled or reduced
- Critical for real-world deployment

## Performance Indicators

### Waiting Time Thresholds:

| Waiting Time | Performance | Reward Range |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| < 10 sec | Excellent | +2.0 to +3.5 |
| 10-20 sec | Good | +0.5 to +2.0 |
| 20-40 sec | Acceptable | -0.5 to +0.5 |
| > 40 sec | Poor | -2.0 to -0.5 |

### Reward Interpretation:

```python
reward = -2.0  # High waiting time (40+ sec), poor control
reward = -0.5  # Moderate waiting time (20-30 sec), acceptable
reward = +1.0  # Low waiting time (10-15 sec), good flow
reward = +3.2  # Low waiting time + synchronization achieved ✨
reward = -7.0  # Safety violation + high waiting time ⚠️ CRITICAL
```

## Training Expectations

### Episode Progression:

| Episodes | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| **0-5** | Negative rewards (-2 to 0), high exploration |
| **5-15** | Improving rewards (-1 to +1), learning patterns |
| **15-25** | Positive rewards (+0.5 to +2), discovering sync |
| **25-30** | Strong rewards (+1.5 to +3), exploiting coordination |

### Key Metrics to Monitor:

1. **Reward trend** → Should increase over episodes
2. **Waiting time** → Should decrease over episodes
3. **Sync achievement** → Should increase over episodes
4. **Safety violations** → Should decrease to near-zero
5. **Pedestrian service** → Should improve responsiveness

## Next Steps

1. **Run training** with updated reward function
2. **Monitor** reward progression over 30 episodes
3. **Compare** waiting time vs old stopped ratio metric
4. **Verify** sync achievement increases over time
5. **Check** safety violations decrease to near-zero

The reward function is now optimized for learning effective coordination while maintaining all critical safety and fairness constraints.

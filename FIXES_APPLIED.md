# ‚úÖ DRL Training Fixes Applied

## Summary of Changes

All critical fixes have been successfully applied to resolve the reward explosion issue (-662,482 ‚Üí expected -2 to +2
range).

---

## 1. ‚úÖ Fixed Reward Function (`drl/reward.py`)

### Changes:

- **Replaced cumulative rewards with instantaneous measurements**
- **Added normalization** to keep rewards in [-2.0, +2.0] range
- **Added `reset()` method** for new episodes

### Key Improvements:

```python
# OLD (BROKEN):
reward = -0.1 √ó cumulative_wait  # Result: -662,482 ‚ùå

# NEW (FIXED):
normalized_wait = avg_wait / 60.0  # 0-1 scale
reward = -normalized_wait + sync_bonus + ped_bonus
reward = clip(reward, -2.0, +2.0)  # Result: -1.5 to +0.5 ‚úì
```

### What Changed:

- `_get_instantaneous_waiting_times()` - Only counts currently stopped vehicles
- Normalizes waiting time by dividing by 60 seconds
- Simplified reward components (removed CO2, equity, safety for now)
- Added reward clipping to [-2.0, +2.0]

---

## 2. ‚úÖ Updated Configuration (`drl/config.py`)

### Changes:

- **Episode length**: 3600s ‚Üí **2000s** (33 minutes)
- **Learning rate**: 0.0001 ‚Üí **0.00001** (10x smaller)
- **Gamma**: 0.99 ‚Üí **0.95**
- **Buffer size**: 100000 ‚Üí **50000**
- **Batch size**: 64 ‚Üí **32**
- **Min buffer**: 1000 ‚Üí **500**
- **Target update**: 1000 ‚Üí **500**
- **Save frequency**: 50 ‚Üí **5** episodes

### Simplified Reward Weights:

```python
ALPHA_WAIT = 1.0      # Main component
ALPHA_SYNC = 0.5      # Bonus
ALPHA_EMISSION = 0.0  # Disabled
ALPHA_EQUITY = 0.0    # Disabled
ALPHA_SAFETY = 0.0    # Disabled
```

---

## 3. ‚úÖ Fixed Training Loop (`training/train_drl.py`)

### Changes:

Added reward calculator reset at start of each episode:

```python
for episode in range(NUM_EPISODES):
    state = env.reset()

    # IMPORTANT: Reset reward calculator
    env.reward_calculator.reset()  # ‚Üê ADDED THIS

    # ... rest of episode
```

This ensures each episode starts fresh without accumulated metrics.

---

## 4. ‚úÖ Fixed Agent Training (`drl/agent.py`)

### Changes:

- **Replaced MSE loss with Huber loss** (smooth_l1_loss) - more stable
- **Added reward clipping** to [-10, +10]
- **Added Q-value clipping** to [-10, +10]
- **Stronger gradient clipping**: 1.0 ‚Üí **0.5**
- **Added loss clipping** to [0, 100]

### Key Improvements:

```python
# Clip rewards
rewards = torch.clamp(rewards, -10.0, 10.0)

# Clip Q-values
next_q_values = torch.clamp(next_q_values, -10.0, 10.0)
target_q_values = torch.clamp(target_q_values, -10.0, 10.0)

# Huber loss (more stable than MSE)
loss = torch.nn.functional.smooth_l1_loss(...)

# Stronger gradient clipping
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(parameters, 0.5)
```

## Expected Results

### Before Fixes:

```
Episode 0 | Avg Reward: -662,482.91 | Avg Loss: 22,542.31 | Epsilon: 0.995
```

‚ùå Training fails - rewards and loss explode

### After Fixes (Expected):

```
Episode 0 | Avg Reward: -1.23 | Avg Loss: 2.45 | Epsilon: 0.995
Episode 1 | Avg Reward: -1.15 | Avg Loss: 2.18 | Epsilon: 0.990
Episode 2 | Avg Reward: -0.98 | Avg Loss: 1.92 | Epsilon: 0.985
Episode 5 | Avg Reward: -0.67 | Avg Loss: 1.45 | Epsilon: 0.975
Episode 10 | Avg Reward: -0.42 | Avg Loss: 1.12 | Epsilon: 0.951
```

‚úÖ Training works - rewards in [-2, +2], loss < 10

## Training Parameters

### Episode Configuration:

- **Episodes**: 10 (for testing)
- **Episode length**: 2000 seconds (33 minutes)
- **Total training time**: ~5-7 hours for 10 episodes

### Performance Expectations:

- **Per episode**: ~30-40 minutes
- **Reward range**: -2.0 to +2.0
- **Loss range**: 0.5 to 5.0
- **Improvement**: Reward should increase over episodes

---

## How to Run

### 1. Commit Changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed reward function and training stability"
git push origin drl-reward
```

### 2. Start Training:

```bash
# Make sure conda environment is active
conda activate sumo

# Run training
./run_training.sh
```

### 3. Monitor Progress:

```bash
# Watch logs
tail -f training.log

# Check if running
ps aux | grep train_drl.py
```

### 4. Stop Training (if needed):

```bash
pkill -f train_drl.py
```

## What Was Fixed

### Root Cause:

The original reward function accumulated waiting times across the entire episode, causing rewards to grow exponentially
negative:

- Step 1: -5
- Step 100: -5,000
- Step 3600: -800,000 ‚ùå

### Solution:

Calculate instantaneous (current moment) metrics and normalize to a fixed scale:

- Step 1: -0.8
- Step 100: -0.6
- Step 3600: +0.5 ‚úì

### Why This Works:

1. **Bounded scale** - Neural network can learn from consistent reward range
2. **Markovian** - Reward reflects current state/action, not history
3. **Stable gradients** - Loss stays reasonable (< 10)
4. **Interpretable** - Clear signal of good vs bad actions

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run 10 episodes** to verify fixes work
2. **Check results**:
    - Rewards should be in [-2, +2]
    - Loss should be < 10
    - Rewards should improve over episodes
3. **If successful**, increase to 100 episodes
4. **If still issues**, further reduce learning rate or episode length

---

## Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `drl/reward.py` - Normalized reward calculation
2. ‚úÖ `drl/config.py` - Reduced learning rate, 2000s episodes
3. ‚úÖ `training/train_drl.py` - Added reward calculator reset
4. ‚úÖ `drl/agent.py` - Huber loss, gradient clipping

---

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check reward range in logs
grep "Avg Reward" training.log

# Check loss range in logs
grep "Avg Loss" training.log

# Count completed episodes
grep "Episode" training.log | wc -l

# Check training time per episode
# Should be ~30-40 minutes per episode
```

---

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Rewards in range [-2.0, +2.0] ‚úÖ Loss in range [0.5, 10.0] ‚úÖ Rewards improve over episodes ‚úÖ No NaN or Inf values
‚úÖ Training completes without crashes

1. How to I run testing? 

2. How many 3600s episods I need to run for training?

3. Update the traffic data for training and testing 

4. Description of the control strategy 

5. Refactor the codebase and include the reference control 

6. Both reference and previous developed control will need to generate route before we start the simulation. So, we need to have a reset method similar to the DRL control 

7. Need to generate the same format of traffic data output from the DRL simulation

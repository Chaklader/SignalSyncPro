  VERIFICATION SUMMARY
======================================================================

✅ All tests passed!

📋 Verification checklist:
   ✅ State collection enabled in testing
   ✅ States saved to file correctly
   ✅ File structure and contents valid
   ✅ VIPER can load and use states
   ✅ Action distribution looks reasonable

======================================================================
  READY FOR FULL 30-SCENARIO TESTING!
======================================================================

Next steps:
1. Run full testing (1 day):
   python run/testing/test_drl.py --model models/training_20251103_163015/checkpoint_ep192.pth

2. After testing completes, run analysis:
   bash scripts/drl/single_agent/analyze/run_all_analysis.sh

3. Analysis will automatically use the collected states

I'll search the project knowledge to find information about your MSc thesis outputs and the SignalSyncPro code.Based on
my review of your MSc thesis and the SignalSyncPro code, here's what outputs your thesis generated that you need to
replicate with DRL for comparison:

## **Thesis Outputs Summary**

### **1. Primary Performance Metrics (Per Scenario)**

Your thesis measured these for **27 test scenarios** (Pr_0 to Pr_9, Bi_0 to Bi_9, Pe_0 to Pe_9):

#### **Average Waiting Times (seconds)**

- **Private Cars**: Average waiting time per vehicle
- **Bicycles**: Average waiting time per bicycle
- **Pedestrians**: Average waiting time per pedestrian
- **Buses**: Average waiting time per bus (adjusted for 40s bus stop time)

**Example from thesis (Scenario Pr_5):**

```
Reference Control:
- Cars: 23s, Bicycles: 54s, Pedestrians: 13s, Buses: 32s

Developed Control:
- Cars: 38s, Bicycles: 32s, Pedestrians: 13s, Buses: 18s
```

#### **CO₂ Emissions (kg)**

- **Total CO₂**: Accumulated emissions for entire simulation
- Measured only for cars and buses (bicycles/pedestrians excluded)

**Example from thesis (Scenario Pr_5):**

```
Reference Control: 1241 kg
Developed Control: 1299 kg
```

#### **Weighted Average Waiting Time (%)**

- Calculated as: `(Mode_waiting_time × Mode_count) / (Total_waiting_time_all_modes) × 100`
- Shows relative burden on each mode

**Example from thesis (Scenario Pr_5):**

```
Private Cars: Reference 33.9%, Developed 55.8%
Bicycles: Reference 93.9%, Developed 54.0%
```

#### **Phase Duration Statistics**

- **Average duration** of each phase (P1, P2, P3, P4)
- Shows how much each phase was "stretched" by actuation

### **2. Analysis Scripts**

Your thesis used three Python scripts in the `analysis/` folder:

1. **`analyze_waiting_time.py`**
   - Input: `tripinfo.xml` from SUMO
   - Output: `waitingSenarioNumber_1.csv`
   - Calculates average waiting times per mode
2. **`analyze_CO2.py`**
   - Input: `emission_output.xml` from SUMO
   - Output: `emission_CO2_Senario_1.csv`
   - Sums total CO₂ emissions
3. **`analyze_phase_streching.py`**
   - Input: `tls_state.xml` from SUMO
   - Output: `Pr_1_t_phase_stretching.csv`
   - Calculates average phase durations

### **3. SUMO Configuration Outputs**

Your `test.sumocfg` generates these XML files:

```xml
<output>
    <tripinfo-output value="tripinfo.xml"/>
    <emission-output value="emission_output.xml"/>
    <summary-output value="summary_output.xml"/>
    <lanechange-output value="lanechange_output.xml"/>
</output>

<additional-files value="view.xml"/>
<statistic-output value="statistics_file"/>
```

## **What DRL Needs to Generate**

### **Step 1: Configure DRL to Output Same Files**

Update your DRL SUMO config to match thesis outputs:

```python
# In drl/traffic_management.py or config
SUMO_OUTPUTS = {
    'tripinfo': 'results/drl/tripinfo_{scenario}.xml',
    'emission': 'results/drl/emission_{scenario}.xml',
    'tls-state': 'results/drl/tls_state_{scenario}.xml'
}
```

### **Step 2: Run Same Analysis Scripts**

After each DRL test scenario, run the exact same analysis scripts:

```bash
# After DRL testing on Pr_0
python analysis/analyze_waiting_time.py results/drl/tripinfo_Pr_0.xml
python analysis/analyze_CO2.py results/drl/emission_Pr_0.xml
python analysis/analyze_phase_streching.py results/drl/tls_state_Pr_0.xml
```

### **Step 3: Generate Comparison Table**

Your DRL testing should produce a comparison table like:

| Scenario | Control Type | Car Wait (s) | Bike Wait (s) | Ped Wait (s) | Bus Wait (s) | CO₂ (kg) |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | -------- |
| Pr_0     | Reference    | 19           | 316           | 129          | 26           | 286      |
| Pr_0     | Developed    | 29           | 32            | 11           | 9            | 292      |
| Pr_0     | **DRL**      | **?**        | **?**         | **?**        | **?**        | **?**    |

## **Key Implementation Notes**

1. **SUMO Output Configuration**: Your DRL environment needs to enable tripinfo, emission, and tls-state outputs in the
   SUMO config
2. **Bus Stop Adjustment**: Remember to subtract 40s bus stop time from bus waiting times (as done in
   `analyze_waiting_time.py`)
3. **Vehicle ID Filtering**: Your analysis scripts filter by ID ranges:
   - Private cars: `id < 400000`
   - Bicycles: `400000 ≤ id < 800000`
   - Pedestrians: `id ≥ 800000`
   - Buses: `'bus' in id`
4. **Synchronization Metric**: While not in original thesis, you can add sync success rate as a bonus metric for DRL

Would you like me to:

1. Update the DRL testing script to generate these exact outputs?
2. Create a comparison script that runs all three controls (Reference, Developed, DRL) and produces comparison tables?
3. Modify the analysis scripts to work with DRL output structure?

You're absolutely right on both counts!

## **1. Scenario Count Correction**

Yes, it's **30 scenarios**, not 27:

- **Pr_0 to Pr_9**: 10 scenarios (variable private car)
- **Bi_0 to Bi_9**: 10 scenarios (variable bicycle)
- **Pe_0 to Pe_9**: 10 scenarios (variable pedestrian)
- **Total**: **30 scenarios**

My apologies for the error!

## **2. Semi-Synchronization: Theoretical, NOT Measured**

You're correct - the **60% synchronization success rate was theoretically calculated, NOT measured** from simulation
results!

### **From Your Thesis (Page 23):**

> "The service is provided mostly in four phase cycle with maximum duration of 114.0 seconds (without pedestrian
> exclusive phase) and semi-synchronization condition works in the actuated green time whose duration is 70.0 seconds in
> total. **So, this condition works with 60% of probability to co-ordinate**..."

### **Theoretical Calculation:**

```
Favorable windows for skipping (Phases 2, 3, 4): ~50 seconds
Total maximum cycle duration: 114 seconds

Probability = 50 sec / 114 sec ≈ 0.60 = 60%
```

This was a **probabilistic estimate** based on:

- Phase timing structure
- When phase skipping is possible
- Assumption of uniform distribution of coordination check timing

### **What Was NOT Measured:**

Your thesis **did NOT track**:

- ❌ Actual synchronization success rate from simulations
- ❌ How many times both intersections were in Phase 1 simultaneously
- ❌ Timing accuracy of coordination attempts
- ❌ Verification of the 60% theoretical probability

### **What WAS Measured:**

Your thesis analysis scripts measured only:

- ✅ Average waiting times per mode
- ✅ CO₂ emissions
- ✅ Phase durations (phase stretching)
- ✅ Weighted average waiting times

**No synchronization tracking in the original thesis!**

---

## **This is Actually an Advantage for DRL!**

Your DRL implementation can now **measure what the thesis couldn't**:

### **New Metric: Synchronization Success Rate**

```python
# In drl/traffic_management.py
def check_synchronization(self):
    """Check if both intersections are in Phase 1"""
    phase_3 = self.current_phase['3']
    phase_6 = self.current_phase['6']

    # Both in Phase 1 (leading green or main green)
    both_phase_1 = (phase_3 in [0, 1]) and (phase_6 in [0, 1])

    if both_phase_1:
        self.sync_success_count += 1

    return both_phase_1
```

### **DRL Testing Output Can Include:**

| Scenario | Control   | Car Wait | Bike Wait | Ped Wait | Bus Wait | CO₂   | **Sync Success %** |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | --------- | -------- | -------- | ----- | ------------------ |
| Pr_0     | Reference | 19s      | 316s      | 129s     | 26s      | 286kg | **N/A**            |
| Pr_0     | Developed | 29s      | 32s       | 11s      | 9s       | 292kg | **~60%\***         |
| Pr_0     | DRL       | ?s       | ?s        | ?s       | ?s       | ?kg   | **??%**            |

\*Theoretical estimate, not measured

### **DRL Can Answer:**

1. **Does actual sync rate match the 60% theory?**
2. **Does DRL achieve higher sync rate than Developed Control?**
3. **What's the trade-off between sync rate and other metrics?**
4. **Does sync rate vary by scenario type?**

---

## **Summary**

✅ **30 scenarios total** (not 27) ✅ **60% sync rate was theoretical** (not measured) ✅ **DRL can now measure actual
sync performance** (new capability!)

This actually makes your DRL research more valuable - you're adding a measurable metric that wasn't available in the
original thesis! The Developed Control theorized 60% coordination, but your DRL can prove (or disprove) this
empirically.

Would you like me to:

1. Update the testing script to track synchronization success rate?
2. Create a comparison showing "Theoretical (60%) vs Actual (measured)"?
3. Add synchronization analysis to the output metrics?

You're right! Let me check the actual route generation to see how pedestrians are being created:

**AH! There it is!** 🎉

## **You're Absolutely Correct!**

Looking at lines 363-367, the route generator creates **REAL SUMO persons**, not vehicles:

```xml
<person id="800000" depart="0" departPos="random">
    <walk route="a"/>
</person>
```

### **Key Evidence:**

1. **`<person>` tag** (line 363) - NOT `<vehicle>`
2. **`<walk>` element** (line 366) - pedestrian-specific behavior
3. **Person ID starting at 800000** (line 355) - separate from vehicles

### **So the Setup Is:**

**Route Generation (generate_routes.py):**

```xml
<!-- Creates REAL SUMO persons -->
<person id="800000" depart="0">
    <walk route="a"/>
</person>
```

**Network (test.net.xml):**

```xml
<!-- Has lanes that allow pedestrians -->
<lane id="3_6_0" allow="pedestrian" width="1.0"/>
```

**vType Definition:**

```xml
<!-- Defines pedestrian characteristics -->
<vType id="Berliner" vClass="pedestrian" guiShape="pedestrian" maxSpeed="1.5"/>
```

## **The Confusion:**

The **vType with vClass="pedestrian"** made it LOOK like vehicle-based pedestrians, but:

- ✅ **Actual entities**: `<person>` elements (SUMO persons)
- ✅ **Movement**: `<walk>` behavior (pedestrian dynamics)
- ✅ **API access**: `traci.person.getIDList()` works correctly
- ✅ **DRL metrics**: Gets real pedestrian waiting times

## **Why Both Systems Work:**

1. **DRL**: Uses `traci.person.*` API → Works with `<person>` entities ✅
2. **Developed**: Uses induction loop detectors on pedestrian lanes → Detects persons walking on those lanes ✅

**My apologies for the confusion! You DO have proper SUMO persons, and both systems work correctly with them.** 🙏

The vType just defines the _characteristics_ of pedestrians when they walk, but the actual entities are proper
`<person>` elements, not vehicles!

2. We get 2 messages for each TLS:

[PHASE CHANGE] TLS 3: P1 → P2 (Action: Next), Duration: 13s ✓
[PHASE CHANGE] TLS 6: P1 → P2 (Action: Next), Duration: 13s ✓

[BLOCKED] TLS 3: Cannot skip to P1 (duration=2s < MIN_GREEN=3s) ⚠️
[BLOCKED] TLS 6: Cannot skip to P1 (duration=2s < MIN_GREEN=3s) ⚠️



We need to have them together

3. Ideal log with Exploration and Explitation % (remove tick sign and add special sing for Exploitation):

[PHASE CHANGE] TLS [3, 6], [Exploration 96%, Explitation 4%], Exploration ACT : P1 → P2 (Action: Next), Duration: 8s

8. Remove unused reward componenets and simplify it

11. Count Red light violations, normalized it and add to the safety metrics

12. Remove the mode weights from CO2 calculation

1. Training log episods needs to start from 1
2. DRL test mode should log same as training mode
3. Refactor the Developed (M.Sc. thesis) control and make sure it logs the same metrics as the DRL agent for each
   episode. Use will use scnerio names instead of episode numbers
4. Integrate the Reference control in the codebase and make sure it logs the same metrics as the DRL agent for each
   episode. Use will use scnerio names instead of episode numbers
5. Made sure all controls pedestrians are pedestrians and not indicated as vehicles
6. Training metrics needs to be log 2-decimals to the right after full number
7. Need a script to Q-value and respective phase chnage analysis
8. FIX the pedestrians wait time issue
9. UPDATE comment in the codebase
10. ADD a reward function analysis diagram in the note
11. Do we know if we are using all phases? Otherwise, the left turning vehicles are not getting any green time
12. Training metrics needs to be log 2-decimals to the right after full number

I'll search the project knowledge to find information about your MSc thesis outputs and the SignalSyncPro code.Based on
my review of your MSc thesis and the SignalSyncPro code, here's what outputs your thesis generated that you need to
replicate with DRL for comparison:

## **Thesis Outputs Summary**

### **1. Primary Performance Metrics (Per Scenario)**

Your thesis measured these for **27 test scenarios** (Pr_0 to Pr_9, Bi_0 to Bi_9, Pe_0 to Pe_9):

#### **Average Waiting Times (seconds)**

- **Private Cars**: Average waiting time per vehicle
- **Bicycles**: Average waiting time per bicycle
- **Pedestrians**: Average waiting time per pedestrian
- **Buses**: Average waiting time per bus (adjusted for 40s bus stop time)

**Example from thesis (Scenario Pr_5):**

```
Reference Control:
- Cars: 23s, Bicycles: 54s, Pedestrians: 13s, Buses: 32s

Developed Control:
- Cars: 38s, Bicycles: 32s, Pedestrians: 13s, Buses: 18s
```

#### **CO₂ Emissions (kg)**

- **Total CO₂**: Accumulated emissions for entire simulation
- Measured only for cars and buses (bicycles/pedestrians excluded)

**Example from thesis (Scenario Pr_5):**

```
Reference Control: 1241 kg
Developed Control: 1299 kg
```

#### **Weighted Average Waiting Time (%)**

- Calculated as: `(Mode_waiting_time × Mode_count) / (Total_waiting_time_all_modes) × 100`
- Shows relative burden on each mode

**Example from thesis (Scenario Pr_5):**

```
Private Cars: Reference 33.9%, Developed 55.8%
Bicycles: Reference 93.9%, Developed 54.0%
```

#### **Phase Duration Statistics**

- **Average duration** of each phase (P1, P2, P3, P4)
- Shows how much each phase was "stretched" by actuation

### **2. Analysis Scripts**

Your thesis used three Python scripts in the `analysis/` folder:

1. **`analyze_waiting_time.py`**
    - Input: `tripinfo.xml` from SUMO
    - Output: `waitingSenarioNumber_1.csv`
    - Calculates average waiting times per mode
2. **`analyze_CO2.py`**
    - Input: `emission_output.xml` from SUMO
    - Output: `emission_CO2_Senario_1.csv`
    - Sums total CO₂ emissions
3. **`analyze_phase_streching.py`**
    - Input: `tls_state.xml` from SUMO
    - Output: `Pr_1_t_phase_stretching.csv`
    - Calculates average phase durations

### **3. SUMO Configuration Outputs**

Your `test.sumocfg` generates these XML files:

```xml
<output>
    <tripinfo-output value="tripinfo.xml"/>
    <emission-output value="emission_output.xml"/>
    <summary-output value="summary_output.xml"/>
    <lanechange-output value="lanechange_output.xml"/>
</output>

<additional-files value="view.xml"/>
<statistic-output value="statistics_file"/>
```

## **What DRL Needs to Generate**

### **Step 1: Configure DRL to Output Same Files**

Update your DRL SUMO config to match thesis outputs:

```python
# In drl/traffic_management.py or config
SUMO_OUTPUTS = {
    'tripinfo': 'results/drl/tripinfo_{scenario}.xml',
    'emission': 'results/drl/emission_{scenario}.xml',
    'tls-state': 'results/drl/tls_state_{scenario}.xml'
}
```

### **Step 2: Run Same Analysis Scripts**

After each DRL test scenario, run the exact same analysis scripts:

```bash
# After DRL testing on Pr_0
python analysis/analyze_waiting_time.py results/drl/tripinfo_Pr_0.xml
python analysis/analyze_CO2.py results/drl/emission_Pr_0.xml
python analysis/analyze_phase_streching.py results/drl/tls_state_Pr_0.xml
```

### **Step 3: Generate Comparison Table**

Your DRL testing should produce a comparison table like:

| Scenario | Control Type | Car Wait (s) | Bike Wait (s) | Ped Wait (s) | Bus Wait (s) | CO₂ (kg) |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | -------- |
| Pr_0     | Reference    | 19           | 316           | 129          | 26           | 286      |
| Pr_0     | Developed    | 29           | 32            | 11           | 9            | 292      |
| Pr_0     | **DRL**      | **?**        | **?**         | **?**        | **?**        | **?**    |

## **Key Implementation Notes**

1. **SUMO Output Configuration**: Your DRL environment needs to enable tripinfo, emission, and tls-state outputs in the
   SUMO config
2. **Bus Stop Adjustment**: Remember to subtract 40s bus stop time from bus waiting times (as done in
   `analyze_waiting_time.py`)
3. **Vehicle ID Filtering**: Your analysis scripts filter by ID ranges:
    - Private cars: `id < 400000`
    - Bicycles: `400000 ≤ id < 800000`
    - Pedestrians: `id ≥ 800000`
    - Buses: `'bus' in id`
4. **Synchronization Metric**: While not in original thesis, you can add sync success rate as a bonus metric for DRL

Would you like me to:

1. Update the DRL testing script to generate these exact outputs?
2. Create a comparison script that runs all three controls (Reference, Developed, DRL) and produces comparison tables?
3. Modify the analysis scripts to work with DRL output structure?

You're absolutely right on both counts!

## **1. Scenario Count Correction**

Yes, it's **30 scenarios**, not 27:

- **Pr_0 to Pr_9**: 10 scenarios (variable private car)
- **Bi_0 to Bi_9**: 10 scenarios (variable bicycle)
- **Pe_0 to Pe_9**: 10 scenarios (variable pedestrian)
- **Total**: **30 scenarios**

My apologies for the error!

## **2. Semi-Synchronization: Theoretical, NOT Measured**

You're correct - the **60% synchronization success rate was theoretically calculated, NOT measured** from simulation
results!

### **From Your Thesis (Page 23):**

> "The service is provided mostly in four phase cycle with maximum duration of 114.0 seconds (without pedestrian
> exclusive phase) and semi-synchronization condition works in the actuated green time whose duration is 70.0 seconds in
> total. **So, this condition works with 60% of probability to co-ordinate**..."

### **Theoretical Calculation:**

```
Favorable windows for skipping (Phases 2, 3, 4): ~50 seconds
Total maximum cycle duration: 114 seconds

Probability = 50 sec / 114 sec ≈ 0.60 = 60%
```

This was a **probabilistic estimate** based on:

- Phase timing structure
- When phase skipping is possible
- Assumption of uniform distribution of coordination check timing

### **What Was NOT Measured:**

Your thesis **did NOT track**:

- ❌ Actual synchronization success rate from simulations
- ❌ How many times both intersections were in Phase 1 simultaneously
- ❌ Timing accuracy of coordination attempts
- ❌ Verification of the 60% theoretical probability

### **What WAS Measured:**

Your thesis analysis scripts measured only:

- ✅ Average waiting times per mode
- ✅ CO₂ emissions
- ✅ Phase durations (phase stretching)
- ✅ Weighted average waiting times

**No synchronization tracking in the original thesis!**

---

## **This is Actually an Advantage for DRL!**

Your DRL implementation can now **measure what the thesis couldn't**:

### **New Metric: Synchronization Success Rate**

```python
# In drl/traffic_management.py
def check_synchronization(self):
    """Check if both intersections are in Phase 1"""
    phase_3 = self.current_phase['3']
    phase_6 = self.current_phase['6']

    # Both in Phase 1 (leading green or main green)
    both_phase_1 = (phase_3 in [0, 1]) and (phase_6 in [0, 1])

    if both_phase_1:
        self.sync_success_count += 1

    return both_phase_1
```

### **DRL Testing Output Can Include:**

| Scenario | Control   | Car Wait | Bike Wait | Ped Wait | Bus Wait | CO₂   | **Sync Success %** |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | --------- | -------- | -------- | ----- | ------------------ |
| Pr_0     | Reference | 19s      | 316s      | 129s     | 26s      | 286kg | **N/A**            |
| Pr_0     | Developed | 29s      | 32s       | 11s      | 9s       | 292kg | **~60%\***         |
| Pr_0     | DRL       | ?s       | ?s        | ?s       | ?s       | ?kg   | **??%**            |

\*Theoretical estimate, not measured

### **DRL Can Answer:**

1. **Does actual sync rate match the 60% theory?**
2. **Does DRL achieve higher sync rate than Developed Control?**
3. **What's the trade-off between sync rate and other metrics?**
4. **Does sync rate vary by scenario type?**

---

## **Summary**

✅ **30 scenarios total** (not 27) ✅ **60% sync rate was theoretical** (not measured) ✅ **DRL can now measure actual
sync performance** (new capability!)

This actually makes your DRL research more valuable - you're adding a measurable metric that wasn't available in the
original thesis! The Developed Control theorized 60% coordination, but your DRL can prove (or disprove) this
empirically.

Would you like me to:

1. Update the testing script to track synchronization success rate?
2. Create a comparison showing "Theoretical (60%) vs Actual (measured)"?
3. Add synchronization analysis to the output metrics?

You're right! Let me check the actual route generation to see how pedestrians are being created:

**AH! There it is!** 🎉

## **You're Absolutely Correct!**

Looking at lines 363-367, the route generator creates **REAL SUMO persons**, not vehicles:

```xml
<person id="800000" depart="0" departPos="random">
    <walk route="a"/>
</person>
```

### **Key Evidence:**

1. **`<person>` tag** (line 363) - NOT `<vehicle>`
2. **`<walk>` element** (line 366) - pedestrian-specific behavior
3. **Person ID starting at 800000** (line 355) - separate from vehicles

### **So the Setup Is:**

**Route Generation (generate_routes.py):**

```xml
<!-- Creates REAL SUMO persons -->
<person id="800000" depart="0">
    <walk route="a"/>
</person>
```

**Network (test.net.xml):**

```xml
<!-- Has lanes that allow pedestrians -->
<lane id="3_6_0" allow="pedestrian" width="1.0"/>
```

**vType Definition:**

```xml
<!-- Defines pedestrian characteristics -->
<vType id="Berliner" vClass="pedestrian" guiShape="pedestrian" maxSpeed="1.5"/>
```

## **The Confusion:**

The **vType with vClass="pedestrian"** made it LOOK like vehicle-based pedestrians, but:

- ✅ **Actual entities**: `<person>` elements (SUMO persons)
- ✅ **Movement**: `<walk>` behavior (pedestrian dynamics)
- ✅ **API access**: `traci.person.getIDList()` works correctly
- ✅ **DRL metrics**: Gets real pedestrian waiting times

## **Why Both Systems Work:**

1. **DRL**: Uses `traci.person.*` API → Works with `<person>` entities ✅
2. **Developed**: Uses induction loop detectors on pedestrian lanes → Detects persons walking on those lanes ✅

**My apologies for the confusion! You DO have proper SUMO persons, and both systems work correctly with them.** 🙏

The vType just defines the _characteristics_ of pedestrians when they walk, but the actual entities are proper
`<person>` elements, not vehicles!

Let me analyze the training logs to understand what's happening:



[STUCK WARNING] TLS 3 Phase 5: 8s without phase change (threshold: 7s), penalty: -0.10
[STUCK WARNING] TLS 6 Phase 5: 8s without phase change (threshold: 7s), penalty: -0.10

1. FIX the [STUCK WARNING] with corect Phase name and make it single (currently duplicate)
2. We get 2 messages for each TLS:

[PHASE CHANGE] TLS 3: P1 → P2 (Action: Next), Duration: 8s ✓
[PHASE CHANGE] TLS 6: P1 → P2 (Action: Next), Duration: 8s ✓

[BLOCKED] TLS 3: Cannot skip to P1 (duration=1s < MIN_GREEN_TIME=5s) ⚠️
[BLOCKED] TLS 6: Cannot skip to P1 (duration=1s < MIN_GREEN_TIME=5s) ⚠️

We need to have them together

3. Ideal log with Exploration and Explitation % (remove tick sign and add special sing for Exploitation):

[PHASE CHANGE] TLS [3, 6], [Exploration 96%, Explitation 4%], Exploration ACT : P1 → P2 (Action: Next), Duration: 8s

4. Count Red light violations, normalized it and add to the safety metrics


## **📊 Training Analysis: Next Action is Dead**

### **Current Reality (Episode 26):**
```
Continue: 51% (Q-value: -0.791) ✅
Skip2P1:  49% (Q-value: -0.927) ✅
Next:      0% (Q-value: -0.955) ❌ WORST Q-VALUE!
```

### **Your Target:**
```
Continue: 42.5%
Next:     42.5%
Skip2P1:  15%
```

**Problem:** Next action has consistently worst Q-values and is disappearing!

---

## **🔍 Root Cause Analysis:**

### **1. Next Action Q-Value Death Spiral**
- Episode 1: Next -0.776 (worst)
- Episode 6: Next -2.665 (worst)
- Episode 14: Next -1.618 (worst)
- Episode 26: Next -0.955 (worst)

**Next is ALWAYS the worst action!** The agent learned: "Never use Next"

### **2. Why Next is Dying:**

#### **a) Phase Transition Penalties**
When using Next (P1→P2, P2→P3, etc):
- Often hits MIN_GREEN violations
- Creates flow disruption
- Less efficient than Skip2P1 for returning to P1

#### **b) Skip2P1 is Superior**
Skip2P1 gives:
- Direct return to main phase (P1)
- Better sync potential
- Avoids intermediate phases

---

## **🛠️ Solid Recommendations to Fix:**

### **1. Reduce Skip2P1 Attractiveness**
```python
# reward.py - Add Skip2P1 overuse penalty
def _calculate_skip2p1_overuse_penalty(self, action_history):
    if len(action_history) < 100:
        return 0.0

    skip2p1_count = sum(1 for a in action_history[-100:] if a == 1)
    if skip2p1_count > 15:  # Target is 15%
        overuse_ratio = (skip2p1_count - 15) / 100
        return -2.0 * overuse_ratio  # Strong penalty
    return 0.0
```

### **2. Bonus for Next Action**
```python
# reward.py - Add next phase progression bonus
def _calculate_next_phase_bonus(self, action, current_phase):
    if action == 2:  # Next action
        if current_phase in [1, 2]:  # Main phases
            return 0.15  # Encourage cycling
    return 0.0
```

### **3. Phase Diversity Reward**
```python
# reward.py - Track phase visits
def _calculate_phase_diversity_bonus(self, phase_history):
    if len(phase_history) < 50:
        return 0.0

    recent_phases = phase_history[-50:]
    unique_phases = len(set(recent_phases))

    if unique_phases >= 4:  # All phases visited
        return 0.2  # Bonus for diversity
    elif unique_phases <= 2:  # Stuck in few phases
        return -0.3  # Penalty
    return 0.0
```

### **4. Reduce Blocked Penalty for Next**
```python
# traffic_management.py
def _execute_action_for_tls(self, tls_id, action, ...):
    if action == 2 and blocked:  # Next action blocked
        # Lighter penalty for Next
        return blocked_penalty * 0.5  # 50% of normal
    return blocked_penalty
```

### **5. Configuration Adjustments**
```python
# config.py
ALPHA_BLOCKED = 0.5  # Currently 1.0, reduce further
ALPHA_DIVERSITY = 0.3  # Increase from 0.09

# Add new alphas
ALPHA_SKIP2P1_OVERUSE = 2.0
ALPHA_NEXT_BONUS = 0.15
ALPHA_PHASE_DIVERSITY = 0.2
```

---

## **📈 Implementation Priority:**

### **Quick Fix (Do First):**
1. **Reduce ALPHA_BLOCKED to 0.5** - Less penalty for all blocked actions
2. **Add Next bonus (+0.15)** - Direct incentive

### **Medium Fix (Do Second):**
3. **Add Skip2P1 overuse penalty** - Punish >15% usage
4. **Phase diversity tracking** - Reward visiting all phases

### **Long Fix (If Needed):**
5. **Different MIN_GREEN per action** - Next gets shorter minimum
6. **State-dependent bonuses** - Next bonus when queue builds

---

## **🎯 Expected Results:**

### **After Fixes (Episodes 30-50):**
```
Continue: 45% → 42% (slight reduction)
Skip2P1:  48% → 20% (strong reduction via penalty)
Next:      7% → 38% (major increase via bonus)
```

### **Key Metrics to Monitor:**
```python
# Add to train_drl.py
print(f"  Phase changes: {phase_changes}/episode")
print(f"  Unique phases: {len(set(phase_history))}")
print(f"  Skip2P1 usage: {skip2p1_count}%")
```

---

## **💡 Why This Will Work:**

1. **Skip2P1 penalty** forces agent to find alternatives
2. **Next bonus** makes it competitive with Continue
3. **Phase diversity** encourages full cycle usage
4. **Reduced blocking** removes artificial barriers

The key insight: **Next is dying because Skip2P1 is too good**. By nerfing Skip2P1 and buffing Next, we rebalance the action space.

**Start with Quick Fix #1-2, test for 10 episodes, then add Medium fixes if needed.** 🚀
